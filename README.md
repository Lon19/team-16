# JP Morgan Code For Good Team 16
## Organization: [CLIC Sargent](https://www.clicsargent.org.uk/)

### Mission
CLIC Sargent fights tirelessly to stop cancer destroying young lives. We know everyone is different, so we work hard to help when each child and young person needs it most. We shape the work we do around six core principles; day to day support, financial support, homes from home, limiting the damage, bereavement support and campaigning.

### Context
No one understands the impact of being diagnosed with cancer as a child, teenager or young adult more than those young people themselves. What CLIC Sargent does know is that is messes with parts of their lives that are important to them, and having help and advice with those things can make a massive difference. CLIC Sargent look to provide that go-to place for everything you might need, no matter how long theyâ€™ve been dealing with it.

### Challenge Statement
CLIC Sargent is looking for a technical solution, in the format of a game, to help children and teenagers with cancer:
- Explore & communicate their feelings
- With a distraction whilst receiving treatment
- Cope during the different parts of the cancer journey
- Promote positive emotional health & wellbeing
